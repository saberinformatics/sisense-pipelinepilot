# A widget for [Sisense Prism](https://documentationv7.sisense.com/v5/elasticube-manager/introduction-to-elasticube-manager/) to run [Pipeline Pilot](http://accelrys.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-pipeline-pilot) protocols and webservices.

Add fantastic data processing capabilities to [Sisense Prism](https://documentationv7.sisense.com/v5/elasticube-manager/introduction-to-elasticube-manager/) which already has a performance-tuned data repository and a powerful visualization UI. Connect [Pipeline Pilot](http://accelrys.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-pipeline-pilot) protocols to [Sisense](https://documentationv7.sisense.com/v5/elasticube-manager/introduction-to-elasticube-manager) data queries as they are performed by users in Sisense Prism.

Add a modern, data-connected and amazingly powerful user interface to [Pipeline Pilot](http://accelrys.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-pipeline-pilot) protocols and web applications. [Sisense Prism](https://documentationv7.sisense.com/v5/elasticube-manager/introduction-to-elasticube-manager/) is a fast reporting database that responds to complex queries in seconds.

The sisense-pipelinepilot widget is available to the community as open-source code under the MIT license. For those users who need additional assurance, commercial support is available directly from [Saber Informatics](https://saberinformatics.com). We are located in Massachusetts, US.

## Compatibility
Sisense Prism: v6, v7.
Pipeline Pilot Server: Pipeline Pilot v9.2 or later, including 2018. Windows or UNIX.

## Installation

The widget has been implemented as a plugin for Sisense Prism. Download the `pipelinepilot` folder into your C:\Program Files\Sisense\PrismWeb\plugins\ folder. If the plugins folder doesnâ€™t exist, just create it. Within a few seconds Sisense will scan and load the plugin. You can then manage it in the [admin interface](https://documentation.sisense.com/managing-plug-ins/).

There is no need to restart Sisense Prism. 

See the note below on enabling cross-origin resource sharing between the two servers ([CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)).

## Note on [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism for web applications to pull interactive content from multiple servers via scripting, in this case Prism and Pipeline Pilot. For PLP v2018 and later, in the Admin Portal / Setup / Server Configuration, add your Sisense Prism server name in the box next to "Allow Cross-origin Requests". For PLP prior to v2018, add the following lines to the file apps\scitegic\core\packages_win64\apache\httpd-2.2.31\conf\httpd.conf (the exact path may vary depending on your PLP server version):
```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
         SetEnvIf Origin "http(s)?://(sisenseservername|localhost)$"
AccessControlAllowOrigin=$0
         Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin
%{AccessControlAllowOrigin}e env=AccessControlAllowOrigin
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true
</IfModule>
```

## Usage
In a dashboard, add a new widget (Pipeline Pilot), select one or more data columns for it to read from the elasticube, and set a Pipeline Pilot protocol URL to run.
